This is info about the passion project for after finishing WDI. I'm still trying to figure out, but my proposition is to create a website dedicated to nerdy topics such as gaming, comics and animation. I plan to do the front-end development (and possibly back-end) and some of the design work for this site. By working on this project, I'll enjoy creating something that I'm interested in while also enhancing my portfolio.
 </p>
 <h> To achieve my goals I'll need to: </h>
 <ul>
 <li> Create something you like even though it may be nerdy and awkward to some people</li>
 <li> Having your code to work will require a lot of trial and error. It will never work the first time around </li>.
 <li> Patience is key. Having your code not work will certainly be frustrating. But by being patient and calm, I'll eventually diagnose the issue </li>

 </ul>
