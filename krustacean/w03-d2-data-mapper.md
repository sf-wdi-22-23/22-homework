1.Imagine we're storing and working with a large amount of hobbies. What attributes would you include on a Hobby object type? What methods might you create for a Hobby object type to help us manage hobby data?

**Attributes**: id, name, difficulty, cost, type of activity, age range, danger.

**Methods:**
GET All hobbies
GET hobbies by Attributes
POST new hobby with arguments for type

2.Imagine we're storing and working with a large maount of cohorts. What attributes would you include in a Cohort object type? What methods might you create for a Cohort object type to help us manage cohort data?

**Attributes**:id, subject, number, list of all students, start-date, end-date, course-cost, completion rate, dropout-rate, demographic data, class performance and eventually hiring performance

**Methods:**:
POST new student
Get all students
GET all classes
put students
POST new class

3.Think back to the lab from today and to other interactions you've had with data. Object data Mappers give us tools to work with any kind of data. What attributes might you give a generic DataObject object type? What methods might you give a generic DataObject object type based on the ways weve been using data so far?

DELETE BY ID, GET BY ID, GET ALL, DELETE ALL,
UPDATE BY ID, UPDATE attribute in all
