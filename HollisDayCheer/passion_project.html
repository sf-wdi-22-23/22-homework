	<p>One idea for a project is a website that helps turns other websites into gifs? Like you could give it a netflix show and a timestamp and it will gif it. I know there are programs that do this for youtube, and also programs that can turn portions of the screen into gif, but it seems like something that would be hard but fun to do? I am not sure what else I could do, but I am sure that I will be able to think of something
	</p>
	<p>Another idea could be a website that sorts twitter for you? A lot of tweets are very very very dumb, but if you could sort of rate tweets by number of retweets/favorites as a fraction of their total followers/time? Some sort of algorithm </p>

		<li>The biggest thing to help me through this project is having GA as a motivator for me to actually do stuff. Keeping with it is important, and having some sort of accountability, more than just my want to finish smoething, is going to be a big help for me fixing it</li>
		<li>Another thing I need to keep in mind is the whole Growth Mindset thing. I very much do not have a growth mindset, and will need to talk to myself in order to keep it up to further myself as a person and succeed. </li>
		<li>Lastly, I will need to not worry about other people's opinions of my code. I fit the stereotype better than most, but am still very self-conscious of others opinions. While I do not expect anything like what was described in the article about real coders to happen at general assembly, I will need to keep that in mind as I carry on and complete this work. </li>
