		<li class = "Question">I do not fully understand how classes work with HTML. The one intro site gave the &ltclass=foo bar&gt example that would give a class= &quotfoo&quot and then bar, so would this make two classes one foo one bar? is that the same as writing foobar? What would the bar actually denote, another way of editing whatever element it is describing?</li>
		<li class = "Question">I have a hard time telling apart where the css cares about tag versus class versus id in terms of which style is editing which, especially with the p and the # and the .p and the .className this is messing with my head.  </li>
		<li class = "Question">I am having a hard time understanding the whole id versus class thing. The css reading said that idâ€™s are unique on the page? Does that mean I can &quot t have two things with the same id on the same page? How would that work with a style sheet that goes to two different pages? When would I use an id versus a class? It said that if I had two things named sparticus I would see the difference, but the fact of the matter is I did not. </li>
