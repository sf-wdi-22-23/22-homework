1) List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms)

a) <input type="text">:  Can be used to enter names, email addresses, features.  Can be qualified by attributes where needed.

b) <select><option>:  Useful for drop down lists, eg. date of birth / credit card type etc.

c) <input type="checkbox">:  Used in "I have read and agree to the terms and conditions..."


2) In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API.

a) Client = A program that interacts with a server via an API.  The Client will send requests for information to the server.  

b) Server = Large computer / store of data that responds to requests (usually from a client)

c) API = A program that runs on top of the server that allows better communication between the server and facilitates the client fetching information (from the server)



<!-- 
Questions:

1) When it says the "for" in a label references an input's id not it's name attribute, does that mean the "for" IS the id or what is this saying?  Unclear from the reading...  In the top example, the element gives <label for="name">Page Name</label>...  How does this fit together?

2) What does it mean under <input type="text"> when it says the type attribute can be ommitted?  Does this mean it can be written <input "text">?  Or is it saying that the type attribute doesn't need to be repeated?
