                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'd like to know why my bootstrap exercise isn't working for the last item on the list. I can't seem to make it create the 3 columns.</li>
                    <li>Could someone explain again how to structure the .col-lg-3 (or whatever) items? I understand that the number of columns need to add to 12. I didn't get a chance to write it down and when I try to implement that part, it doesn't seem to do anything but print the .col-lg-3 to the screen. All of the examples I found when I google it, say that you should use that structure but the code included never has that in there.</li>
                    <li>I can't think of a 3rd question right now.</li>
                </ul>

               <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I will use the keyboard shortcuts once I remember them all. I will have to find a list of them that I can reference.</li>
                    <li>I think the Bootstrap site will be useful once I actually get the hang of it.</li>
                    <li>I think the arrays will be useful but I do need more practice with them.</li>
