## BLANK_TEMPLATE

Basic frontend template for projects using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

Make sure to rename the repo folder, after you clone it, so that you don't confuse yourself later. Try renaming when you clone:

``` bash
git clone CLONE_URL your_project_name
```
After you have cloned and renamed your repo, cd into the folder. 
```bash
cd your_project_name
```
Next check your git remote origin.
```bash
git remote -v
```

It is pointing to the blank_template repo but you want it to point to your own repo. You need to remove the current remote and place your own in.
```bash
git remote remove origin
```
Next go to your Github page and make a new repo with the same name you just created locally. **Don't click Initialize this repository with a README**. Create Repo, then you will see two options, choose the second " push an existing repository from the command line" follow the instructions

```bash
git remote add origin your_github_project.git
git push -u origin master
```
