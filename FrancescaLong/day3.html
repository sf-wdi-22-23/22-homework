I want him to know that he can do what ever he wants when he grows up and isn't stuck in any one job. I worked at my last job for far too long (11 years!) even though I hated it. He is an amazing kid most of the time and is occassionally a 3 foot tyrant. His friends, Dolly and Mr. Skipit, keep him in line when things get frantic though.</p>
