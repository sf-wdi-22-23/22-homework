Question 3 - I'd create two objects. One for the cohorts with ID, subject, number and classroom at attributes. The second one would be for hobbies and would contain an ID, name and cost.

Question 4 - The hobby object would need the attributes above plus a method to add new hobbies, one to remove hobbies, and one to edit hobbies. 

Question 5 - For a generic data object, some of the attributes to include would be a unique ID, name, description, category, sub-category, cost/charge (generally as a numeric field but modifiable to string), units included, duration. Generic methods are add new, delete, and edit/modify existing items.
