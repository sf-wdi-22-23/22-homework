Ideas for project 2:

1. A to do list with email reminders of things that happen occassionally (paying taxes, doing flex spending, shopping for health insurance, birthdays, anniversaries, reminding you to purchase dog food and diapers, etc.) The doggie got hungry and the kid is in danger of getting soggy. Need help!

2. Chinese holiday calendar that reminds you when you have to visit the family gravesites. It has flowers delivered to your home for the number of graves you have to visit and sends reminders the week before the holiday (and if possible, adds a calendar event).

3. Shopping helper to help you find children's shoes. If you enter the measurements of your kid's feet, it will let you know what size to look for and will recommend brands. Ideally, it would also let you know of stores in the area that carry children's shoes.

4. Holiday gift suggestions. What does my 13 year old niece want for christmas? How about an 82 year old grandpa? What in the world do I get for my husband who seems to have everything?

5. An app that sends you a daily joke that relates to something you have to do today. If you laugh, maybe you'll remember to do that thing.
