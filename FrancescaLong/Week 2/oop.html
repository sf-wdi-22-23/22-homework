  	<li>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?
  	<br> 
  		<ul><br>
  			<li>A constructor is a method called at the moment an object is instantiated. It usually has the same name as the class containing it. It is a pointer, or reference, to the fuction that created it.</li>
  			<br>
  			<li>A prototype is the parent of an object. An object inherits all of its properties from its parent. Javascript is a prototype language.</li>

  		</ul>
  <br>
  	<li>What does "this" mean inside a constructor? - It refers to the current object. It works with properties within the class. 
  	</li>
  	<br>
  	<li>Could you provide some more examples of the difference between a constructor and a prototype? I found definitions but I am not sure I really understand the difference or how they are applied.</li>
  	<br>
  	<li>What is the difference between the capitalized Function() and lower case function()? The definitions that I found online used the same words to describe each other which breaks the basic tenents of a definition. Can someone please define these in actual English?</li>
