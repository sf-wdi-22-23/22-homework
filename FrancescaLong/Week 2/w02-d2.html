    <h2> Week 2 Day 2 Homework - Francesca Long </h2>
  </center>
  <ul>
  	<li>3 input types and real world examples:</li>
  	<br> 
  		<ol>
  			<li>Drop down list - these are often used for lists of states when filling out address forms.</li>
  			<br>
  			<li>File picker - used to choose pictures to upload to facebook or any other site.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Text area - used for things like name inputs. It can be limited in length to prevent users from going crazy but allows them to enter text relatively freely.</li>
  		</ol>
    <br>
  	   <li>Definition of client, server, and API.</li> 
  	   <br>
  	   <ol>
       <li>Client - A client is the end user computer that an individual uses to access the internet. It is this machine that sends requests for information to the server and receives the data back. The person using the client can read items, fill out forms, follow links, etc. on the websites.</li>
  	   <br>
  	   <li>Server - The server hosts the website and any underlying data needed to power the website. It receives requests from the client and provides the new web pages when a link is clicked, provides data when requested by the user / client computer.</li>
       <br>
       <li>API - An API acts as an interface between the client and the server. It runs on the server and makes the data from the client computer digestible by the server or vice versa allowing the two to interact smoothly and quickly.</li>
  </ul>
