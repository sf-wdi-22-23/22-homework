			<ul>
				<li>Is it more advisable to link out as much as possible instead of local content?</li>
				<li>Are there (or will there be) new codes for emerging technologies like smartwatches where screen size is smaller than extra small?</li>
				<li>Are most of the html pages we are learning compatible universally throughout devices, provided the browsers are up to date?</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="col-xs-6">
			<ul>
				<li>I am actually really curious about the menu dropdown and linking and know that will always be used later</li>
				<li>Commands that recognize devices and auto displays based on those recognitions seem to be a must use nowadays</li>
				<li>Continued exploration of the different types of existing bootstrap coding will probably make life a lot easier</li>
