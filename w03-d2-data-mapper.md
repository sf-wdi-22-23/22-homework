hobbies - you would want the name, level of involvement, people you do the hobby with, contact numbers associated with the hobby, cost, location(s), associated hobbies,  active true false ets. etc - as far as methods go you would want to be able to add new hobbies and all of their attributes - if someone got more involved with a hobby or stopped a hobby you would want to have some way to show that. 

cohorts - you would want each cohort to have an id but you would want to be able to switch students from one cohort to the other. subject and classroom are good too but it would be a good idea to denote which cohorts are active , incoming and which cohorts are alumni.
