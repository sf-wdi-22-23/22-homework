What is JavaScript work? JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language.
What is the call stack? Why is it there? Call stack is where the stack frame is located. It is a data structure that records the current location within the program that JavaScript is operating on. Functions are added to and removed from the call stack as they are processed.
What is the event loop? Why do we have it? Is it a part of the JavaScript language? While the call stack is single-threaded, requests and actions from webAPIs can be queued in a separate location from the call stack. These requests/callbacks are stored in the task queue, and then are pushed to the call stack by the event loop when the call stack becomes vacant.
What is blocking? How can it slow down your code? How can avoiding it speed it up? Blocking is a behavior of code that slows or delays processing time. Blocking code can jam up the call stack. Since the call stack is single threaded, sluggish code prevents other code from being processed. Asynchronous callbacks allow us to avoid blocking. In a way, it allows Javascript to run in a pseudo-multi-threaded fashion.
