I would create two separate array of objects. The first array would contain the cohort objects, and the other would contain the hobby objects.
I would add attributes such as id numbers and specific categories in order to further classify the hobbies. It would be beneficial to include methods that allow us to add/edit and pull pieces of information(key/value pairs) from each object/hobby.
I would add attributes such as location, date, and an array of enrolled students.
Attributes such as id numbers would be essential for organization. Methods that allow us to configure data types and other information within the DataObject would be beneficial.
