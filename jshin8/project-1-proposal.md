Project 1: Calendr...... Datebook.......Ravr To be decided!!!

	Project Description/Scope:

	I want to build a web application that allows party-goers/ravers to create a social calendar and share them with other users. This calendar would be editable by all participating users. I hope to implement all the features necessary to enable these basic tasks. The ability to search for and 'friend' other users may be beyond my current capabilities.

	User Stories:
		-as a user, i want to be able to create a simple user profile. logging in will be necessary in order to access my calendar.
		-as a user, i want to be able to create a new calendar and share it with other users of my choosing.
		-as a user, i want to be able to create and edit content/events on my calendar.

	Milestones:
		-Login/signup info stored and accessible via database.
		-create customizable calendar
		-save edits made to calendars; save user's activity in order to access calendar in the future.
		-create simple logo, sharpen appearance with CSS, bootstrap

	Object Model Brainstorm:

	I believe that user data (i.e. events on calendar) should be referenced. Since data from calendar will be shared between users, storing this data in one place and referencing it would be more efficient than storing in multiple locations.
