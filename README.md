#Brian Gabot's Homework repo

Homework will be turned in to your fork of this repository daily.

##Setup

To set up your initial homework repository do the following:

* fork this repo to create a copy of it on your github account
* clone the forked repo from your github account onto your computer inside your `dev/` directory
* `cd` into the newly cloned repo on your computer
* `mkdir **GIT-USER-NAME**`
* `cd **GIT-USER-NAME**`
* `echo "#**YOUR NAME**'s Homework repo" > README.md` to set up your repo's README
* `git add -A` to stage your changes
* `git commit -m "inital commit"` to have git save your changes
* `git push origin master` to put your changes up on github!

**GIT-USER-NAME** should be replaced with your actual git user name (must be exact)

**YOUR NAME** should be your actual name.



##Submit homework

Each day you will submit your homework by doing the following from within your homework repo on your computer:

* copy any required files into your homework repo directory as instructed in homework writeup
* `git add -A` to stage all your changes
* `git commit -m "homework commit"` to have git save the changes -- feel free to add to the commit message if you'd like
* `git push origin master` to put the changes up on github
* go to your homework repo's page on your account on github.com
* create a pull request according to the guidelines below

####Pull request details

(Must be in this format)

**Title:** `w##d##`

Replace ## with week and day number (eg w01d02  = homework for week 1 day 2)

**Message:**

```
comfort: #
completeness: #

Message about your experience goes here
```

Replace the `#`s next to comfort and completness with a number (1 - 5) to represent how comfortable you are with the topic and how much of the assignment you were able to complete.  A 1 is the lowest (least comfortable / very little complete), and a 5 is the highest (most comfortable / fully complete).
