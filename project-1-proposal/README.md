Project 1 proposal
====================

###Science Fair finder idea
I used to work for an  organization that worked with over 400 science fairs all over the world. Their app to find a fair was always a little clunky and we thought it would be nice to have a search function with a map to make the fairs across the country and the world more visual but we never got around to it. This would both help show inequality in science fair access across the globe as well as to help search for the closest fair. 

###App description
This app will take science fair data (supplied by my previous employer) and map each fair to a map using a mapping API - google maps or map box etc. this data will pull up by state or country and display on a map what city the fair is in as well as information about the fair including website and date of fair
