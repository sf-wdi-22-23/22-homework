Project One Proposal discussed with instructor Alex W.

Scope: A photo-sharing web app service that enables its users to sign up, log in, log out, share photos, and pin on Google Maps the location where the photo was taken.

User story (updated version based on feedback from conversation with Alex W.): John is into photography. He just moved to San Francisco, and wants to share with his old friends from his hometown, the new photos of the San Francisco neighborhoods he has explored so far. And John also wants to show the locations of where exactly in San Francisco, the photos were taken. John visits the web site, creates an account, logs in, enters the direct URL of a photo already hosted on a third-party web service, then adds the location of where the photo was taken.
