        <p>This is a paragraph for Week 2 Day 1 Homework.
</br>
Here are the questions and asnwers:
</br>

<ul>
<li>Question 1: What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype? In my understanding, the prototype is basically the function (in a classless prototype oriented programming), while the constructor is the execution of such function in a class based object oriented programming.</li>
<li>Question 2: What does this mean inside a constructor? "this" inside a constructor is a keyword which indicates the current object and which allows accessing properties within the class (in an class based object oriented programming).</li>
</ul>
        </p>
