I decided to use the ordered list below to list in order of preference a few of the cool things that I learned about Day 4 Homework.

Here is the list:

<ol>
<li>Ways to grab the jQuery library using a "CDN".</li>
<li>Learned about the Elements and the Console tabs in the Chrome Developer Console.</li>
<li>The differences between the .text() jquery method as a "getter" versus as a "setter".</li>
</ol>
