Homework!

Look at the data inside this directory's data.js file. How would you model this data with JavaScript object types?


Imagine we're storing and working with a large amount of hobbies. What attributes would you include on a Hobby object type? What methods might you create for a Hobby object type to help us manage hobby data?
=> I'd consider nesting all hobby objects into 1 single array, and then add a unique ID as an attribute to each object.
=> I'd consider function methods for managing the hobby objects.

Imagine we're storing and working with a large maount of cohorts. What attributes would you include in a Cohort object type? What methods might you create for a Cohort object type to help us manage cohort data?
=> I'd consider nesting all cohort objects into 1 single array, and then use the already existing unique ID as an attribute to each object.
=> I'd consider function methods for managing the cohort  objects.

Think back to the lab from today and to other interactions you've had with data. Object data Mappers give us tools to work with any kind of data. What attributes might you give a generic DataObject object type? What methods might you give a generic DataObject object type based on the ways weve been using data so far?
=> I'd consider nesting all objects of the same category into 1 single array, and then add a unique ID as an attribute to each object.
=> I'd consider function methods for managing the generic DataObject objects.
