Q: What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?

A: A constructor creates a new instance of an object with certain undefined properties and methods, while a prototype is an inheritance instance where the desendants stem from a prototype object.


Q: What does this mean inside a constructor?

A: 'This' refers to the new object being created.

I don't have any specific questions however this read was really difficult (as in, not simple for a new programmer) and I think a more simplistic tutorial style would be easier for students in the future. I'd definitely like to know more about prototype based programming and what the benefits are to object construction vs prototypes.
