<ol>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?
	<li>Assigning methods within the constructor creates a new function object for every class object, and by naming functions it will be easier for debugging. </li>
	<li>The prototype approach is very efficient. Prototypes are prefered when you use inherited classes, you can override methods of the derived class you invoke the method of base class with the same name. You cant do this with methods defined in the constructor.  </li>


	<li>'This' is used to call another constructor in the same class. </li>
	</ol>
