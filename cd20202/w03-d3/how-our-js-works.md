##How our JS works

1. Javascript work?

2. Call stack is functions / events to be excuted, its important because it does them in the order they come up.

3. Event loop is the inbetween of the call stack and queue that is interpreted by the browser.

4. Blocking is what happens when your call stack becomes slowed down because it is not asynchronous.
