	<p>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</p>
	<p>A constructor points to the Function() that created the point from which you are retrieving the constructor from.The prototype is a property of Function() objects.</p>
	<p>What does this mean inside a constructor?</p>
	<p>The constructor function itself is called. Inside the function, this is set to the object that is being constructed. This allows to work with properties from within the class.</p>
