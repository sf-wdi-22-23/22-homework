	1. I don't really understand how to answer this question.
	2. I would start off by giving each hobby an ID. I would also add a Type or Category attribute
	to each hobby to help classify them better i.e. water or land activity. I would then create methods
	to allow you to search for hobbies by Type or Category.
	3. I would add a date, location and teacher attributes to help differentiate each cohort.
	I would then create methods to allow you to search for the right cohorts based on these attributes.
	4.Definitely need ID and name attributes. Then its best to add information about parent classes
	as well as description types that apply to the other objects.
