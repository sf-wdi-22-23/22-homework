1. The main difference of a constructor is that it is called at the moment of instantiation within classes. Prototype is classless but reuses behaviors of any classes like using inheritance principles.

2. When using 'this ' in a constructor, it refers to only the current object, with properties from within the class.    Outside of the constructor, you must refer to the object you want by name.

So the biggest difference in using OOP is the data and where it is in the order of importance? Meaning when writing a function, the function tells you how to do something and then inputing data, and OOP needs data first in order to proceed with what you want to do with it.
