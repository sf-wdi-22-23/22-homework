I really enjoyed the CSS game. I had seen all of these selectors before but it was great to be reminded of them and to play the game! Also, Animating Ryu was pretty neat. I like the idea of appending images and then animating them. super cool. There are seemingly a lot of things that can go wrong though. Super neat in any case!
