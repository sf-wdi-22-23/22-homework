What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype? 

	A constructor is "A method called at the moment an object is instantiated. It usually has the same name as the class containing it." Prototypes do no use classes - Javascript is a prototype based language that instead of classes uses functions as other languages would use classes.

What does 'this' mean inside a constructor? 
	'This' referrs to itself. "The keyword this, which refers to the current object, lets you work with properties from within the class."

I'm not really sure I fully understand the prototype method - i will have to review this.
