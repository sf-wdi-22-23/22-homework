<h1>List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms):</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>text - you would use this for inputting in text like names or towns not from a list</li>
		<li>checkbox - when you want to give only certain options and when you want people to be able to pick more than one.</li>
		<li>file picker - when you want the person to upload a file into the website </li>
	</ul>
<h1>In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API.</h1>

	<ul>
	<li>client - the user end of the web - you your computer, your smartphone etc. that makes requests to the server.</li>
	<li>server - a computer(or many) with no real gui but who clients request info from to transport information on the web. </li>
	<li>API - data from some entity in a form where computers can access and manipulate it easliy - it allows for a lot of interaction between websites.</li>


<h1>question?</h1>

<p>how come in lesson 3 of the API  it would work when the content type and the data format matched but the accept header did not? it also gave a different type of information... whats going on here?</p>
