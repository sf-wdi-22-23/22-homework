					<h1>Answer the following questions.</h1>
					
					<h2>List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms)</h2>
					<li>In a file input, you can select a file to upload and then request a GET as a client.</li>
           			<li>In an email input, you can sign up for a newsletter.</li>
            		<li>In a submit input, you can submit your food order GET request, possibly submitting through an application, JSON.</li>

					<h2>In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API.</h2>
					<li> A client sends a request to a server with HTTP.</li>
           			<li>A server is just like a computer, but way more powerful with no monitor and is accessed remotely with rigid methods in which to be accessed.</li>
            		<li>An API is a digestible method to retrieve data.</li>

					<h2>Additional questions.</h2>
					<li> Nothing right now. </li>
