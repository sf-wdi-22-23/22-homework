	<p> As a graphic designer, I have designed countless websites for other people, but when it comes to designing my own, well that falls by the wayside. This is partly because there is never time, there are always other projects to work on, and also because I have always wanted to build it myself. This course will finally give me the tools I need and the time to focus on my website and to not limit the site to merely a typical portfolio site. I will be able to add other elements and functions to the site, making it stand out and illustrating my new abilities as not only a graphic designer but a web developer.

	<li> In the Ted Talk, I think what he said about how we are not chained to our current capabilities is so true and so important to remember. Often we forget this and shelter ourselves from trying anything new due to our fears and what we believe to be our weaknesses. Once we push ourselves, we often find that we can in fact do so much more. This is one of the reasons I am on this course, to push myself. </li>
	<li> In the 'Things I Wish' article, I definitely agree with her first statement about knowing what you want to code. What I want to code is something that I have wanted for a long time: my very own, kick ass website. When you have deep passion for something, then you will work harder to achieve it. You must also agree as you have decided to name this homework assignment Passion Project. </li>
	<li> I also found her statement 'It never works the first time' rather comforting. It is true with a lot of things that third times the charm. We should not get discouraged if it does not work the first or even the second time. Just keep at it and with determination and that passion we spoke of earlier, we will get there. </li>
