<p><b>List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms)</b></p>
<p>Input: Checkbox - commonly used for surveys or multiple choice questionnaires<br>
Input: Password Field - self explanatory, used to enter password for sites that require membership<br>

<p><b>In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API.</b></p>
<p>Client - "That's a me!" (Mario reference)<br>
Server - accepts requests from client and executes <br>
API - a middleman between a client and a server. The middleman accepts requests from the client and returns data if the request is allowed. The middleman also informs the client about everything they can request, exactly how to ask for it and how to receive it.</p>
