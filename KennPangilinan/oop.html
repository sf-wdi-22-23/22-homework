	<b>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</b><br>
	<p>A constructor is a pointer, a reference to the object. It allows you to create replicate copies of an object. The constructor is set by object, so changing an object constructor property will only change that specific object constructor.</p>
	<p>A prototype is a property of a function objects that no other type of objects have in their property. They share their properties with their objects.

	<b>What does <i>this</i> mean inside a constructor?</b>
	<br>
	<p><i>This</i> is a reference to the current object, the object whose method or construtor is being called. </p>
