<h1> What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype? </h1>
<p1>A constructor is a method called at the moment an object is instantiated. It usually has the same name as the class containing it. It is a method of the class. It's primarily used to set an object's properties or to call methods to prepare the object to use. 

Prototype-based programming is an OOP model, and unlike a constructor, it does not use classes, but rather it first accomplishes the behavior of any class and then reuses it. <p1>

<h1> What is this inside a constructor </h1>
<p2>"This" defines the constructor. It refers to the current object, and lets you work with properties within the class.
