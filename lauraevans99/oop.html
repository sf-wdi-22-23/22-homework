What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?

A prototype is like a class in other languages - it allows for the creation of behavior that can be inherited by instances of that class.  A constructor is a method of the class - it is called immediately when a new instance of a class is created.  The constructor (in javascript implicitly served by the function so no need to write our own constructor method) is used to set the object's properties and call methods to prepare the object for use.

What does 'this' mean inside a constructor?
In a constructor (aka the function), 'this' is referring to the new class instance that is being created.
