Although I have minimal knowledge of JQuery, actually more like next to none, I'm pretty excited about learning the language. Learning how to manipulate methods is godly. How can I not like seeing "$" in my code. The following is what I have learned from the readings:
<br>
-"write less, do more" === "work smart, not hard" 
<br>
-behavior of methods depending on their position in your DOM.
<br>
-"getting a value" and "setting a value"
