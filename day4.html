TIL how to use the .append() function a bit better, as well as it's effects. Towards the end of the streetfighter tutorial,

if you click overzealously, the fireballs fill up the entire screen, rather then the area in front of Ryu.

I also learned the animate function, which seems to be really fun and versatile. Also also: the mousedown command seem


to be an alternative to onClick/click with the bonus of having a unclick (mouseup).

Although I have minimal knowledge of JQuery, actually more like next to none, I'm pretty excited about learning the language. Learning how to manipulate methods is godly. How can I not like seeing "$" in my code. The following is what I have learned from the readings:
<br>
-"write less, do more" === "work smart, not hard" 
<br>
-behavior of methods depending on their position in your DOM.
<br>
-"getting a value" and "setting a value"
