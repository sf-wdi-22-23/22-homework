  2-Rails comes with Sqlite3 database and with  WEBrick, a web server distributed with Ruby by default.
  3- A resource any object that users able to access via URI and perform CRUD
  4-a controller recieves and treats requests from the application, but the route, decides which controller recieves which requests
  5-In Express, the controller was the app.js (in public folder)
  6- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb reminds me the index.ejs (the view)
  7- 
  	*ArticlesController < ApplicationController means that ArticlesController inherit from the ApplicationController class
  	*@article has that @ : it's an An instance variable and has the capability of storing data for each instance of a class
  	*
  8-Active Record  automatically maps column names to model attributes, which means we don't have to declare attributes inside Rails models, as that will be done automatically by Active Record.
  9-Migrations are Ruby classes that are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables
  10- still a little complicated to understand how does it work exactly...
