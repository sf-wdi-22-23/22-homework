Question 1 :
 I would put every object (that have the same attributes) in the same place 
(array of objects  : Hobbies and Cohort)

Question 2 :
I would include an 'id' to have easier access to the data of Hobby object 
type, and as methods, i will create the add(hobby) , update(hobbie), and 
delete(id)methods.

Question 3 :
the ids are already present, which is good, we'll have beter access to the data with the id
the methods to manipulate data are : add(cohort), update(cohort), delete(cohort), the getters methods to get 
information from a cohort

Question 4 :
a generic dataObject type, must have an Id, to help us manage the data
easily, the methods we can give to it : the add, the get, the update, delete
methods
