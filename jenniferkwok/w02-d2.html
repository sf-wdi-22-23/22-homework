List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms)

file picker - useful when we want to send files via e-mails.

checkbox - useful when we want to ask about people's interests and send them promotional e-mails accordingly.

radio buttons - can be widely used in surveys.

In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API.

Client: the computer end that sends out requests and receives data.

Server: Where data is stored and given out.

API: Acts as a middleman between server and user. It receives commands from the user, gets data from server and translates it into a computer layout for the user.
