Project One Proposal

Project one will be an App that allows fantasy football league users to challenge other league teams to "side bets".

A user will log in, and choose which team to challenge by selecting and proposing the wager.

Teams will be included automatically using the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API along with weekly projected points and actual point totals after the actual NFL games have been played.

Eventually I'd like to be able to match up individual positions against each other aside from entire team scores, that may or may not happen in time.

--NOTES--

Sessions would eventually be more likely to be used than cookies if it got to that point, so i may just start out using sessions anyway.

As far as model relationships go, the schemas will probably be embedded.

Wireframe screenshot included.
